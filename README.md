# LUST-LibraryUniversalSwissTool
apps4students-team-5 created by GitHub Classroom

## Why it was created
The idea behind this project is to develop an app that is made by students and serves students in their daily life.
The team was free to come up with their own idea which they wanted to bring to live.
For this purpose most of the students had to learn the flutter framework newly because none of them had used it before.

## Who created it
The students behind this project have a few years of experience in coding with different backrounds for example some were more experienced in embedded programming and others had more experience in higher level programming.
For all of the students in this team this was the biggest project which they had to develop. And one of the first ones where they had to work in a group of people.

## Idea behind this app
The idea behind this app came from a daily problem a student has when studying, especially when the period of the exams is approaching: Not knowing if there is a free space in the library and if it is worth it heading there. Solving this problem became the mission of this team.
For this the core functionality is to have more or less a counter that keeps track of the number of people that are currently in the library by providing a "check in" and "check out" function to a virtual library in the app.
Around this, other functionalities that come in handy while being in a library were implemented.
